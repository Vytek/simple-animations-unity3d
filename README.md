# simple-animations-unity3d

(very) Basic framework which can be expandable at will. It includes 2 basic animations for now - floating and rotation.

# how to use it?

1. Safely import the script into your project. Select your desired GameObject and add new component called Animation. Fill out the variables and you are good to go.

2. Check the Example() method in the script if you wish to do everything programmatically.
